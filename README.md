# 🏠 My Personal Website

This is my personal website built using [Reflex](https://reflex.dev), a Python framework for writing web apps and websites. It showcases my work, and provides information about me. I plan to add more features in the future.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Reflex**: A Python web framework designed for building modern web applications and websites.
- **Python**: The programming language used to develop the website.
- **HTML/CSS**: The standard web development languages used for creating the front-end.
- **GitHub Pages**: The hosting platform used for deploying the website.
- **[Rye](https://rye-up.com)**: A simple tool for creating and managing Python projects written in Rust.

## 🛫 Getting Started

1. Clone the repository using `git clone`.
2. Install the required dependencies with `pip install .`
3. Initialize Reflex with `reflex init`.
4. Run the development server using `reflex run`.
5. Visit `localhost:3000` in your web browser to access the website locally.

## 🚀 Deployment

This website is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages whenever new changes are pushed to the main branch. It's also possible to host it to other platforms such as Netlify by adjusting the GitHub Action. Side Note: In the Action I have to add a `.nojekyll` file to the `gh-pages` branch to prevent GitHub Pages from trying to build the website with Jekyll.
