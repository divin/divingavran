    "description": "For my Master's thesis, I developed expertise in automating experimental data analysis using deep learning techniques. I focused on improving the performance of an existing object recognition model based on Faster R-CNN by using hyperparameter optimization to achieve better detection results of diffraction patterns in experimental data. Additionally, I designed and created a smaller YOLO-based model that was capable of performing similar tasks as the original model, but with significantly faster processing times.",

    "description": "Through my studies in physics, I developed a solid foundation in both fundamental and advanced topics. As I continued to pursue my education, I focused on specializing in computational physics, taking computer science courses and developing strong proficiency in Python. For my Bachelor's thesis, I conducted research on the formation of planets on a protoplanetary disk, gaining valuable insights into the migration of planets driven by the disk torques and offering a unique perspective on these phenomena.",
