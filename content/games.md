In my childhood, I was a huge fan of video games. I spent countless hours playing them. Nowadays, I find myself more often **creating games** than playing them. I absolutely love the process of game creation, even if finishing a game is a rare event for me. Currently, I'm mostly focusing on creating games for the [**Playdate Console**](https://play.date/). Over time, I realized I prefer SDKs as they are easy to use and have a low entry barrier. The [**Playdate SDK**](https://play.date/dev/) is a perfect fit for me. It's simple, fun, and has a great community. You can find most of my games on my [**itch.io page**](https://divingavran.itch.io).
