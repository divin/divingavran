As someone who has been **playing drums since I was six**, I've always had a **deep connection and passion for music**. My music is mostly **instrumental, with a focus on jazz and hip-hop**. I love **digging out old and obscure recordings and sampling them**. Sometimes my music gets very **experimental**. My main inspiration comes from [**Madlib**](https://www.stonesthrow.com/artist/madlib/) and [**MF DOOM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MF_Doom). You'll find most of my music on my [**Bandcamp**](https://divin.bandcamp.com) or my [**SoundCloud**](https://soundcloud.com/divingavran).
