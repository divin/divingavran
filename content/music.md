My **passion for music** began with **playing drums at six**. I enjoy sampling tracks to create new sounds. Listen on [**Bandcamp**](https://divin.bandcamp.com) and [**SoundCloud**](https://soundcloud.com/divingavran) (I won't post new stuff there unfortunately), where I release beats as _Divin_. I used to release some electronic experiments as _Karasu-san_ (カラスさん, _Mr. Crow_), but I'll continue these experiments as _Divin_. I also share music via my [**YouTube channel**](https://www.youtube.com/@divingavran).
