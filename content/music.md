As someone who has been **playing drums since I was six**, I've always had a **deep connection and passion for music**. Currently, my music is not **focused on any particular genre**. Most of the time, I start by digging out old and obscure recordings and then sampling them. The resulting genre of the track is decided during the creation process based on the samples and the mood I'm in. You'll find most of my music on my [**Bandcamp**](https://divin.bandcamp.com) or my [**SoundCloud**](https://soundcloud.com/divingavran).
