I'm a **Data Scientist** with a **background in Physics** who loves **coding** and digging into **complex data** to find **cool insights**.

When I'm not **crunching numbers**, **training machine learning models**, or **building data pipelines**, you'll probably find me diving into some **creative projects**. I dabble in **music**, **drawing**, **app development**, and **game development**. The last one is a perfect mix of all my interests.

This website is a **showcase** of what I've been up to. Feel free to look around and [**hit me up**](mailto:hello@divingavran.com) if you have any questions or just want to chat.
