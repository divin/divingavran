Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'd describe myself as a curious learner and a jack of all trades. I've had quite a journey, working my way up from "Hauptschule" in Germany (the lower secondary school) to earning a **Master's degree in Physics** and now **working as a Data Scientist**. Along the way, I've been fortunate to explore various fields, including electrical engineering, environmental technology, physics, and machine learning.

During my physics studies, I learned how to **program with Python**, perform **data analysis and visualization**, create **simulations of physical systems**, and apply **machine learning** techniques. My bachelor thesis focused on **planet formation simulations** using [PLUTO](https://plutocode.ph.unito.it) and CUDA. For my master thesis, I had the opportunity to explore **Deep Learning** and its applications in scientific research, helping to optimize an object detection model with **PyTorch and [Optuna](https://optuna.org)** to improve accuracy in detecting diffraction peaks in **[Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grazing_incidence_diffraction)**.

Today, I work as a **Data Scientist**, though my role involves wearing many hats. I contribute to **data analysis and visualization** for generating insights, **model training and deployment** to enhance online marketing strategies, **creating data pipelines** for ensuring data quality, implementing **anomaly detection** to identify issues, and developing **automations** to streamline processes.

In my free time, I enjoy creating things. I make music, develop games and apps, and occasionally draw. Game development is especially rewarding as it combines many things I love: **programming**, **art**, and **music**. I also enjoy **playing video games** and **reading books** (almost daily!). Besides tech, I speak **German** (native), **English** (fluent), and I'm currently learning **Japanese** (I've learned about 700 Kanji and 1,400 vocabulary words so far!). I'm always excited to learn new technologies and keep up with the latest trends in **artificial intelligence** and **machine learning**.

If you're interested in learning more about my work or collaborating on a project, feel free to reach out to me at [hello@divingavran.com](mailto:hello@divingavran.com). I'd love to connect and discuss potential opportunities!
