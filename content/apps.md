Besides games, I also enjoy creating apps. Mainly to experiment with new ideas or solve some problems I encounter in my daily life. If the app is also useful to others, even better! Most of the time, if I create an app, it's a web app or an app for the [**Playdate Console**](https://play.date/). You'll find the Playdate apps on my [**itch.io page**](https://divingavran.itch.io) and the web apps on my [**GitHub page**](https://github.com/divin).
