about-me: |
  I'm Divin, a data scientist with a passion for exploring data for insights. 
  I enjoy software and game development, music creation, art and AI, especially machine learning, natural language processing and computer vision. 
  
  You can find my latest work on GitHub, YouTube, itch.io, Bandcamp, SoundCloud and more. 
  When not working, I love to go for walks with my furry companion üê∂

      As an experienced Python developer with a solid background in statistical analysis, my focus is on extracting actionable insights from complex datasets.  
      Leveraging my applied knowledge, I specialize in building sophisticated machine learning models, and proactively extend existing codebases to automate the analysis process even further.

      For my Master's thesis, I developed expertise in automating experimental data analysis using deep learning techniques. 
      I focused on improving the performance of an existing object recognition model based on Faster R-CNN by using hyperparameter optimization to achieve better detection results of diffraction patterns in experimental data. 
      Additionally, I designed and created a smaller YOLO-based model that was capable of performing similar tasks as the original model, but with significantly faster processing times.

      Through my studies in physics, I developed a solid foundation in both fundamental and advanced topics. 
      As I continued to pursue my education, I focused on specializing in computational physics, taking computer science courses and developing strong proficiency in Python. 
      For my Bachelor's thesis, I conducted research on the formation of planets on a protoplanetary disk, gaining valuable insights into the migration of planets driven by the disk torques and offering a unique perspective on these phenomena.
